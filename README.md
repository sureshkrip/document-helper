# LangChain Documentation Helper
This project loads the document (kidâ€™s short story book) in vector form into a vector database (Pinecone). I've built a small web application using Streamlit to query information from the document. Steps 1, 2, and 3 constitute a one-time process for loading the document into the vector store. Subsequent steps are utilized to retrieve relevant information from the vector database using semantic search and then send it to LLM to obtain an answer for a query.
